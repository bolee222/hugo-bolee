#### What's the role of Student Volunteers?
TEI 2022 is seeking **enthusiastic and interested student volunteers** to help make TEI 2022 this year. TEI 2022 will be a virtual online conference event due to the current omicron COVID-19 outbreak. We require help from online volunteers in facilitating the online activities of the conference. Online volunteers will be expected to facilitate a pleasant virtual conference experience by managing tasks such as crewing the Discord help-desk and being responsible for channel moderation.

Duties might involve but are not limited to:
- Facilitating online sessions (Zoom).
- Moderating discussions in online channels (i.e., Discord, Zoom or YouTube).
- Encouraging and helping attendees into digital rooms.
- Troubleshooting online sessions.
