Studios have always played a major role in TEI conferences, and we want this year to be no different. **Seven studios** have been selected to take place at TEI 2022. Studios will take place on **Sunday, 13 February**, 2022. The exact timing and planning of each Studio will be decided by its organizers, and shared below. For most Studios, you can simply sign up when registering for the conference, though some Studios require participant submissions. See the Studio descriptions to learn more.

#### S1: Engaging with the IoT [Cancelled]

This studio revolves around designing with systemic openness and introduces the IoT Sandbox as a tool to design with systemic openness through multi-activity and multi-person scenarios. The studio knows three learning goals: (1) how to characterize and facilitate a design challenge with systemic openness, (2) how to design with multi-activity and multi-person scenarios, and (3) how to design for diverse interaction styles in a systems context. In a hands-on manner the fundamental concepts and challenges are introduced and experienced through a series of short design sprints. The studio ends with a reflective discussion on the propositions created by the participants, in relation to the learning goals as well as the studio and the IoT Sandbox platform.

####  S2: Rapid Prototyping of 3d Printed Inflatable Forms

In this hands-on workshop we will be outlining how to reliably and quickly prototype 3d printed inflatable forms such as actuators, buttons and pumps using a direct drive FDM 3d printer. The workshop will address flexible printing materials, machine settings, designing for air tightness, post processing and printer modifications as well as an introduction to Fusion 360.

#### S3. Graspable AI (GAI): Physical Forms as Explanation Modality for Explainable AI [Cancelled]

Explainable AI (XAI) seeks to disclose how an AI system arrives at its outcomes. But the nature of the disclosure depends in part on who needs to understand the AI and the available explanation modalities (e. g. verbal and visual). People's preferences regarding explanation modalities might differ, some might prefer spoken explanations compared to visual ones. However, we might also consider broadening the explanation modalities, to consider also tangible and physical forms. Historically, physical forms have mediated people’s interactions with objects, and more recently user interaction with IoT and smart devices, such as smart lighting and robotic vacuum cleaners. But whether it can support AI explanations has not yet been explored.  

In this second studio proposal on Graspable AI (GAI) we seek to explore design qualities of physical forms as an explanation modality for XAI. We anticipate that the design qualities of physical forms and their tangible interactivities can not only contribute to the explainability of AI through facilitating dialogues and relationships and human empowerments, but also contributing to an open environment for criticism. Therefore, our proposal on Graspable AI seeks to contribute to the design agendas for a more transparent, democratic and sustainable AI.

#### S4: Wearable Technology Design and Accessibility Considerations Studio

The studio proposed here will focus on design and accessibility considerations for wearable technology. In this studio we will explore how to develop a robust set of design and accessibility considerations (guidelines) for wearable technology. The course will begin a presentation on wearability and accessibility then participants will engage in an activity using a new Wearable Technology Designer’s Web Tool. The tool can be accessed again after the course and shared with students and colleagues. The course will end with a discussion about what design considerations might need to be added to the tool and what human factors information or other research should be updated.

#### S5: Collaborative Creative Coding Through Drawing Robots [Cancelled]

With the development of end-user fabrication technology, plotters have become increasingly accessible and attractive to a broader community. Since their invention, these 3-axis CNC machines have been connecting digital and analog creation. Plotters have great potential as a tool to bridge the digital-physical divide, allowing learners from a variety of backgrounds to gain immediate satisfaction from their programming by translating digital output into physical artifacts. In addition, due to their roots in art, plotters may be more inviting to students from artistic backgrounds new to programming. In this studio, we investigate plotters' potential in introducing creative programming in collaborative learning environments. By introducing collaborative creative programming through the lens of plotters, we explore solutions to challenges in programming education, collaborative programming, and personal fabrication.

#### S6: How Tangible is TEI: Exploring New Academic Publication Formats

After the successful organization of the first TEI Swatch Exchange as part of the SDC (Student Design Challenge) in 2021, we would like to propose a swatch exchange as a new and physical publication format to TEI, the Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction.  
We believe TEI should take initiative in exploring possibilities of broadening how academic publishing may look like and what novel publication format could be inclusive towards new knowledge and participants to advance academic practices. Furthermore, the focus and nature of the work presented at TEI is uniquely fitted to explore physical publication formats as a novel way to advance, communicate, and cite work that is bridging computing with the physical world. However, we are aware that a physical publication format also poses very specific challenges, there included questions of dissemination, accessibility, and citation, among others. We propose a Studio to deeply engage with the possibilities, potentials, as well as potential problems of physical publication format as a crucial step towards defining plausible processes, forms, and archives for a physical research publication.

#### S7: Designing with Alganyl: A Hands-on Exploration of Biodegradable Plastics

In this studio we explore designing with Alganyl, a sustainable biomaterial, made of food-grade ingredients, that can be fully recycled (zero-waste) or biodegraded in soil. Specifically, Alganyl is a bioplastic formulated to mimic the flexibility and strength of vinyl fabric.This studio will bring together researchers with diverse expertise that will explore embedding color, texture and sensing in Alganyl as well as a variety of fabrication techniques. Participants will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience through making wearables that can sense ultraviolet light or temperature, as well as explore their own creative applications. Participants will also learn about material-centered design methodologies and sustainability within the context of HCI. Lastly participants will be encouraged to share their experiences with designing with Alganyl as well as discuss the impact of biomaterials in sustainable HCI research.
