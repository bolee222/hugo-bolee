<p>Full papers and pictorials published at TEI 2022 are ACM archival publications and will be made available through the ACM in the Digital Library.Pictorials at TEI leverage the power of visual communication for physical design objects, documenting tangible research methods and results.</p>
<h4 id="general-information">GENERAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>Given the increasing popularity and weight of pictorial contributions across academic conferences (DIS, C&amp;C, IASDR), TEI2022continues it triennial tradition for Pictorials track. Pictorials were first introduced at DIS2014 with the aim of supporting the presentation and communication of research ideas, design practice, methods, provocations, insights, and contributions in a more visually rich format. Since then it has been successfully implemented in DIS and C&amp;C conferences and was for the first time implemented in TEI in 2020.</p>
<p>This call is adapted from texts composed by previous Pictorials chairs specifically for TEI 2020 and 2021. We thank the previous years' Pictorial chairs of DIS, C&amp;C, and TEI for the ground breaking work, inspiration and continuous development of Pictorials as a type of contribution format as well as research output in its own right.</p>
<p>The theme for TEI2022 is <strong>Making.Things.Think</strong>. TEI 2022 invites Pictorial contributionsto explore the conference theme with broad interpretation and diverse approaches.</p>
<p>Currently, TEI 2022 is planned to be held physically in KAIST, Seoul, Korea. Of course, if the circumstances require it, there will be an alternative way to present the research and to meet with the TEI community. So please do not hesitate to submit. We will find ways to run the conference in a way that best fits the future situation.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-pictorials">WHAT ARE PICTORIALS?</h4>
<p>Pictorials are papers in which the visual components (e.g. diagrams, sketches, illustrations, renderings, photographs, annotated photographs, and collages) play a major role in conveying ideas and research contributions in addition to the accompanying text. Pictorials leverage the power of visual communication with the effective use of visual languages and high-quality images. They may have a practical or theoretical nature or both.</p>
<p>Through Pictorials, researchers, practitioners, industry professionals, artists, designers, and students from various disciplines, including engineering, interaction design, computer science, product design, media studies, and the arts are encouraged to express and unpack their design practices and projects in visually rich ways.</p>
<p>Pictorials are meant to contribute to knowledge in themselves rather than merely document concepts, methods, and processes that we already know. Visual components can be contributions to design knowledge in and of themselves, as a form of making, but they should also be accompanied by a narrative that helps the TEI audience understand what the knowledge contribution is. It is this scaffolding that transforms a Pictorial into research and guarantees that it can be treated as an argument in research discourse. At the same time, the textual narrative should be just that – a scaffolding to support the contribution of the visual content.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-submit">WHAT TO SUBMIT?</h4>
<p>We welcome submissions related to the rapidly developing field of tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction as well as the conference theme of Making. Things. Think, with a focus on aesthetic, meaningful, and inclusive interactions.In this broad context, submissions may cover diverse types of topics that include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Design decisions and methods employed to create new interactive techniques and tools.</li>
<li>Artistic explorations or practice-based research in or through tangible computational media technologies to support new human-machine interactions.</li>
<li>Perspectives on tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction ranging from arts to science and from design to education.</li>
<li>Other insights, lessons learned, practices or processes of designing and evaluating tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> COVID-19 introduced a variety of complexities to the research community in terms of the deployment and study of research artifacts and interactive experiences. Since for instance, collaborative design activities or workshop-dependent prototyping may have faced limitations, we would like to emphasize that Pictorials will be reviewed in light of such limitations, and reviewers will take these into account when assessing the contribution of the Pictorials.</p>
<p><strong>Some important points to consider when preparing your pictorials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does your work require a Pictorial format, or would it be clearer in a more conventional textual form?</li>
<li>Is the contribution that is presented original and complete? If not, you may want to consider a WIP submission instead.</li>
<li>Is the production value for the images and/or diagrams of high quality?</li>
<li>Are images/diagrams emphasized over text as the primary means of communicating the research contribution?</li>
<li>Are the implications for the TEI research community clear and sound? These may be descriptive, analytic, generative, synthesis-oriented, and even manifestos. In addition, related conclusion or claim is reached through discussion, reflection, and/or evaluation of some sort.</li>
<li>Does every image used in the Pictorial play a meaningful role and clearly present the idea on its own or with the support of text?</li>
<li>Does the placement of images and text compose a good narrative?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="submission-guidelines">SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h4>
<p>Pictorials must be submitted in the TEI2022 Pictorials format (see below) and not exceed 12 pages, excluding references. The first page of the submission should include the submission's title, author(s) and their affiliation(s) (leave blank for double-blind review), and a written abstract of no more than 150 words succinctly describing the background and context of the pictorial as well as its contribution to the TEI community. Further written parts known from other conference formats such as Introduction, Conclusion, Discussion, Acknowledgements, and References are optional. The main part of the submission should be an annotated visual composition and we encourage submissions to use the format creatively. All submissions should be anonymous and submitted via the TEI2022 <strong><a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions">Precision Conference (PCS) system</a></strong> by August 2, 2021.</p>
<p>We strongly advise you to use the InDesign template to compose your Pictorial. If you do not have access to InDesign, please use the Word or Powerpoint templates.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tei.acm.org/2021/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TEI2021-Pictorials-InDesign-template.zip">InDesign template</a></strong></li>

</ul>
<p>There are numerous people working on the Pictorials format. A big thank you to all of them for their efforts, especially to Sabrina Hauser for her work on Pictorial templates over the years, and Laura Devendorf for adapting the templates to TEI.</p>
<h4 id="review-and-selection">REVIEW AND SELECTION</h4>
<p>Submissions will be reviewed in a double-blind process, and authors must ensure that their names and affiliations do not appear on the submitted papers. The author and affiliation sections of the template must be left blank. In case of acceptance, authors will be asked to provide a camera-ready copy that includes this information, along with any recommended improvements as suggested by the reviewers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all references should remain intact. If you previously published a paper and your current submission builds on that work, the reference – with authors – should appear in the references. Submission should NOT have blank references (e.g., &quot;12. REMOVED FOR REVIEWING&quot;). We encourage authors to refer to their previous work in the third person. Further suppression of identity in the body of the paper, while encouraged, is left to the authors' discretion.</p>
<p>Confidentiality of submissions will be maintained during the review process. All rejected submissions will be kept confidential in perpetuity. All submitted materials for accepted submissions will be kept confidential until the start of the conference.</p>
<h4 id="attendance">ATTENDANCE</h4>
<p>After the conditional acceptance of your pictorials on October 4, you have time to upload your revised paper along with a summary of changes until October 25 via PCS. You will be informed about the final acceptance by November 15. Finally, a pre-recorded video of your talk or demo should be submitted by TBC via PCS.</p>
<p>Accepted TEI Pictorials will be distributed by the conference and published in the ACM Digital Library where they will remain accessible to researchers and practitioners worldwide. At least one author is expected to register for the conference before the early registration deadline in order for the final paper to be published in the conference proceedings. Reduced fees will be available for non-presenting attendees.</p>
